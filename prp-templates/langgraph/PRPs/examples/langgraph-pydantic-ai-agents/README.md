```

### Parallel Research Flow:
1. **Guardrail Agent**: Detects research/outreach requests vs normal conversation (lightweight, fast)
2. **Parallel Research Agents** (run simultaneously):
   - **SEO Research Agent**: Search rankings, domain authority, digital presence analysis
   - **Social Media Research Agent**: LinkedIn, Twitter, engagement metrics, thought leadership
   - **Competitor Research Agent**: Market positioning, funding data, competitive intelligence
3. **Synthesis Agent**: Combines all research streams into comprehensive research synthesis with actionable insights
4. **Fallback Agent**: Handles normal conversational requests

### Conversation History Strategy:
- **Parallel Research Agents**: Stream responses to user but don't update conversation history
- **Final Agents**: Only synthesis and fallback agents update conversation history
- **State Merging**: LangGraph uses operator.add to merge parallel agent outputs efficiently

### Performance Optimization Strategy:
- **Parallel Execution**: ~50% faster research through simultaneous agent execution
- **Minimal Guardrail Dependencies**: Guardrail agent uses only session ID for fast routing decisions
- **Specialized Agents**: Each research agent focuses on specific domain expertise
- **Streaming with Fallback**: Real-time feedback from all parallel agents reduces perceived latency
- **Efficient State Merging**: LangGraph manages concurrent state updates using operator.add

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and virtual environment is activated
2. **Environment Variables**: Check `.env` file configuration
3. **Supabase Connection**: Verify Supabase credentials and connection
4. **Brave API**: Verify Brave Search API key is valid
5. **Gmail Setup**: Ensure OAuth2 credentials and compose/send scope configuration
6. **Port Conflicts**: Default port is 8040 for the API server

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Workflow Issues

Check guardrail routing decisions:
- **Research Requests**: Should include research + email creation intent
- **Normal Conversation**: General questions, explanations, casual chat
- **Parallel State Merging**: Verify research data merges correctly with operator.add
- **Synthesis Integration**: Check that synthesis agent receives all research streams

### Common Workflow Patterns

**Successful Parallel Research Flow:**
1. Guardrail detects research intent ‚Üí `is_research_request: true`
2. Three agents execute simultaneously ‚Üí `seo_research`, `social_research`, `competitor_research` populated
3. Synthesis agent combines all research ‚Üí `email_draft` populated, `synthesis_complete: true`

**Conversation Flow:**
1. Guardrail detects conversation ‚Üí `is_research_request: false`
2. Routes directly to fallback agent

### Rate Limiting & API Usage

**Brave Search API:**
- Built-in 1-second delay between API calls to prevent quota issues
- Parallel research flow makes 3 simultaneous API calls (SEO + Social + Competitor)
- Rate limiting helps avoid 429 errors during concurrent execution

## Performance & Cost Optimization Notes

- **Guardrail Efficiency**: Uses smaller model for fast routing decisions
- **Parallel Execution**: ~50% faster research through simultaneous agent execution
- **Specialized Focus**: Each agent optimizes for specific research domain
- **Streaming Strategy**: Real-time feedback from all agents reduces perceived latency
- **State Management**: Efficient concurrent updates using operator.add pattern

This architecture provides both speed and comprehensive research capabilities by executing specialized agents in parallel with intelligent state merging.
