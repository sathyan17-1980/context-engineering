# LangGraph Core Concepts & Architecture

## Overview

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables creating sophisticated agent systems that go beyond simple linear workflows, supporting complex reasoning loops, parallel agent execution, and long-running stateful processes.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Graph-Based Computation
LangGraph uses a graph-based approach where:
- **Nodes** represent individual components or agents (Python functions)
- **Edges** define the flow of execution between nodes
- **State** is shared across all nodes and updated through reducer functions
- **Cycles** are supported, enabling loops and recurring execution patterns

### Pregel-Style Computation
LangGraph implements a Pregel-inspired computation model:
- **Supersteps**: Execution happens in discrete steps where nodes can run in parallel
- **Message Passing**: Nodes communicate by updating shared state
- **Deterministic Execution**: Despite parallelism, results are deterministic
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in checkpointing and recovery mechanisms

## Graph Types

### StateGraph
The primary graph type for most LangGraph applications:
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing import TypedDict

class MyState(TypedDict):
    messages: list
    counter: int

workflow = StateGraph(MyState)
workflow.add_node("process", my_node_function)
workflow.add_edge(START, "process")
workflow.add_edge("process", END)
graph = workflow.compile()
```

### MessageGraph (Legacy)
Simplified graph type focused on message passing:
```python
from langgraph.graph import MessageGraph

workflow = MessageGraph()
workflow.add_node("agent", my_agent)
workflow.add_edge("agent", END)
graph = workflow.compile()
```

## Node Implementation Patterns

### Async-First Design
All node functions should be async for optimal performance:
```python
async def my_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    # Process state
    result = await some_async_operation()
    return {"messages": [result]}
```

### State Updates
Nodes return partial state updates that are merged with the current state:
```python
async def counter_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    current_count = state.get("counter", 0)
    return {"counter": current_count + 1}
```

### Tool Integration
LangChain tools can be bound to nodes for external interactions:
```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
async def search_tool(query: str) -> str:
    return f"Search results for: {query}"

async def agent_with_tools(state):
    # Use tools within node logic
    result = await search_tool.ainvoke("LangGraph patterns")
    return {"messages": [result]}
```

## Edge Types and Routing

### Static Edges
Direct connections between nodes:
```python
workflow.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")
workflow.add_edge("node_b", END)
```

### Conditional Edges
Dynamic routing based on state conditions:
```python
def route_condition(state: MyState) -> str:
    if state["counter"] > 10:
        return "high_count_node"
    else:
        return "low_count_node"

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "counter_node",
    route_condition,
    {
        "high_count_node": "high_count_node",
        "low_count_node": "low_count_node"
    }
)
```

### Parallel Edges with Send()
Fan-out to multiple nodes simultaneously:
```python
from langgraph.graph import Send

def fan_out(state: MyState) -> list[Send]:
    return [
        Send("agent_a", state),
        Send("agent_b", state),
        Send("agent_c", state)
    ]

workflow.add_conditional_edges("coordinator", fan_out)
```

## State Management Architecture

### State Schema Definition
Use TypedDict for performance or Pydantic for validation:
```python
# TypedDict approach (recommended for performance)
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class AppState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    user_input: str
    processed_count: int

# Pydantic approach (recommended for validation)
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AppState(BaseModel):
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    user_input: str
    processed_count: int
```

### State Reducers
Control how state updates are merged:
```python
# Concatenation with operator.add
messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]

# Custom reducer function
def merge_dicts(left: dict, right: dict) -> dict:
    return {**left, **right}

data: Annotated[dict, merge_dicts]
```

## Execution Models

### Synchronous Execution
Basic execution for simple workflows:
```python
result = graph.invoke({"input": "Hello"})
```

### Asynchronous Execution
Preferred for production systems:
```python
result = await graph.ainvoke({"input": "Hello"})
```

### Streaming Execution
Real-time updates during execution:
```python
async for chunk in graph.astream({"input": "Hello"}):
    print(chunk)
```

### Streaming with Updates
Get intermediate state updates:
```python
async for chunk in graph.astream({"input": "Hello"}, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(f"Node {chunk[0]} updated state: {chunk[1]}")
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Node-Level Error Handling
Handle errors within individual nodes:
```python
async def robust_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    try:
        result = await risky_operation()
        return {"result": result}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e), "status": "failed"}
```

### Graph-Level Error Handling
Catch and handle graph execution errors:
```python
try:
    result = await graph.ainvoke(initial_state)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Graph execution failed: {e}")
    # Implement recovery logic
```

### Checkpointing and Recovery
Enable state persistence for fault tolerance:
```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()
graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# Execution with persistence
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "conversation_1"}}
result = await graph.ainvoke(initial_state, config)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Node Optimization
- Keep node functions focused and lightweight
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Minimize state copying in updates

### State Design
- Use TypedDict over Pydantic when validation isn't critical
- Design lean state schemas to reduce serialization overhead
- Use appropriate reducers to avoid state bloat

### Parallel Execution
- Leverage Send() primitive for fan-out patterns
- Design nodes to be stateless where possible
- Consider memory usage with large parallel executions

## Integration Points

### LangChain Ecosystem
LangGraph integrates seamlessly with:
- **LangChain Tools**: Bind tools to specific nodes
- **LangChain LLMs**: Use any LangChain-compatible LLM
- **LangSmith**: Built-in tracing and observability
- **LangServe**: Deploy graphs as web services

### External Systems
Common integration patterns:
- **Databases**: State persistence and data retrieval
- **APIs**: External service integration through tools
- **Message Queues**: Async communication with external systems
- **Web Frameworks**: FastAPI integration for HTTP endpoints

This architecture enables building sophisticated agent systems that can handle complex, long-running workflows with proper state management, error recovery, and production-ready deployment patterns.
