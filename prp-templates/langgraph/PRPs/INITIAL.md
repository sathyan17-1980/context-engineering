# Multi-Agent Content Strategy Platform

## Project Overview

Build a sophisticated LangGraph multi-agent system that creates comprehensive content strategies for businesses. The platform should analyze market trends, competitor content, and user preferences to generate actionable content strategies with specific recommendations.

## Core Requirements

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Research Team**: Specialized agents for different research domains
  - SEO Research Agent: Keyword analysis, search trends, SERP analysis
  - Social Media Research Agent: Platform trends, engagement patterns, viral content analysis
  - Competitor Research Agent: Competitor content audit, gap analysis, positioning insights
  - Market Research Agent: Industry trends, audience analysis, market opportunities

- **Analysis Team**: Data processing and insight generation
  - Content Performance Analyzer: Analyze existing content effectiveness
  - Trend Analysis Agent: Identify emerging patterns and opportunities
  - Audience Insights Agent: Deep-dive user behavior and preferences

- **Strategy Team**: Synthesis and planning
  - Content Strategy Coordinator: Combine all research into unified strategy
  - Editorial Calendar Agent: Create detailed content calendars and schedules
  - ROI Prediction Agent: Forecast content performance and resource allocation

### Coordination Pattern
- Use **Supervisor Pattern** with intelligent routing based on project phase
- Implement **Parallel Research Execution** for simultaneous data gathering
- Enable **Human-in-the-Loop** for strategy approval and client feedback integration

### Key Features

#### 1. Intelligent Research Coordination
```
User Request → Supervisor Analysis → Parallel Research Deployment
                    ↓
    [SEO Agent] [Social Agent] [Competitor Agent] [Market Agent]
                    ↓
            Analysis & Synthesis → Strategy Generation
```

#### 2. Dynamic State Management
- Track research progress across multiple domains
- Maintain conversation context and user preferences
- Aggregate findings from parallel research streams
- Store client-specific insights and historical data

#### 3. Human Approval Workflows
- Strategy review checkpoints before client presentation
- Budget approval gates for high-investment recommendations
- Content calendar approval with modification capabilities
- Client feedback integration with strategy refinement

#### 4. Production-Ready Deployment

    # Integration with market research APIs
```

### Workflow Design

#### Phase 1: Research Coordination (Parallel Execution)
```python
async def research_coordinator(state: ContentStrategyState) -> list[Send]:
    """Deploy parallel research agents based on project requirements."""
    
    client_requirements = state["project_requirements"]
    research_scope = analyze_research_scope(client_requirements)
    
    parallel_agents = []
    
    if research_scope.get("seo_research"):
        parallel_agents.append(Send("seo_research_agent", state))
    
    if research_scope.get("social_research"):
        parallel_agents.append(Send("social_research_agent", state))
    
    if research_scope.get("competitor_research"):
        parallel_agents.append(Send("competitor_research_agent", state))
    
    if research_scope.get("market_research"):
        parallel_agents.append(Send("market_research_agent", state))
    
    return parallel_agents
```

#### Phase 2: Analysis Synthesis
```python
async def analysis_coordinator(state: ContentStrategyState) -> dict:
    """Synthesize all research data into actionable insights."""
    
    all_research = {
        "seo": state.get("seo_research", []),
        "social": state.get("social_research", []),
        "competitor": state.get("competitor_research", []),
        "market": state.get("market_research", [])
    }
    
    synthesis = await create_comprehensive_analysis(all_research)
    
    return {
        "content_performance": synthesis["performance_analysis"],
        "trend_analysis": synthesis["trend_insights"], 
        "audience_insights": synthesis["audience_analysis"],
        "current_phase": "strategy_development"
    }
```

#### Phase 3: Strategy Development with Approval Gates
```python
async def strategy_development_agent(state: ContentStrategyState) -> dict:
    """Develop comprehensive content strategy requiring approval."""
    
    analysis_data = {
        "performance": state["content_performance"],
        "trends": state["trend_analysis"],
        "audience": state["audience_insights"]
    }
    
    strategy = await generate_content_strategy(analysis_data, state["client_info"])
    
    # Check if strategy requires approval
    if strategy["budget_impact"] > state["budget_constraints"].get("approval_threshold", 10000):
        # Trigger human approval workflow
        approval_prompt = f"""
        Content Strategy Approval Required
        
        Client: {state['client_info']['name']}
        Proposed Budget: ${strategy['budget_impact']:,}
        Approval Threshold: ${state['budget_constraints']['approval_threshold']:,}
        
        Strategy Summary:
        {strategy['executive_summary']}
        
        Please review and approve/modify this strategy.
        """
        
        interrupt(approval_prompt)
    
    return {
        "content_strategy": strategy,
        "current_phase": "calendar_development", 
        "approval_status": "pending" if strategy["budget_impact"] > 10000 else "auto_approved"
